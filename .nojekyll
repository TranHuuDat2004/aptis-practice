Hi, good afternoon.
 Hi, welcome to the Carlton Hotel. How can I help you?
 We’ve just driven up from London and we’re going to stay here in York for a few
days. We’d like to book a couple of rooms.
 Ok, sir. So for how many nights is that?
 We’ll be leaving on Monday morning. So, let me see, that’s…3 nights.
 And you said two rooms. Who are the rooms for?
 I’m here with my wife and two kids. They are 9 and 11. Sorry, 9 and 12. The eldest
has just had his birthday. So we’d like one twin room for the kids and another
double for my wife and I.
 Ok, well, we’ve got two rooms available, both en-suite.
 Great. How much are they per night?
 Let me see…the twin room is…40 pounds per night, and the double room is…50
pounds per night.
 Ok, that sounds reasonable. So what is the total for 3 nights for both rooms?
 Let me check…that will be a total of 270 pounds.
 And that includes everything?
 Yes, that price includes tax.
 Ok, can I pay by credit card?
 Yes, sure. You’ll need to pay for the first night now, and you can pay for the other
nights when you leave. Or you can pay for all the three nights now.
 I think I’ll just pay for everything now as we’ll definitely be here till Monday.
 Ok, that’s fine. I’ll just need to take some details from you to confirm the booking.
Can you give me your full name?
 Yes, it’s Michael Fernsby. That’s…F-E-R-N-S-B-Y.
 What’s your date of birth please?
 The 15th of October, 1968.
 The 5th of October, 1968?
 No, the 15th

 Oh, ok, sorry. And can you give me your address?
 Sure. It’s 273, Stanton Court. That’s S-T-A-N-T-O-N. London, WC2D, 5JB.
 WC2D 5JB?
 Yes, that’s right.
 And your telephone number?
 My mobile number is...hold on, just let me check, I can never remember it…here it
is…it’s 08773 879456.
 Ok. Those rooms are booked for you then.
==================================================================================
 Ok, I know we’re a bit out of town here. Can you give me some information about
getting into the centre of town. We’ll probably head in tomorrow.
 Well, you could drive in, but the parking is not great in town. It’s difficult to get a
space and is quite expensive if you are staying there all day.
 Yes, we’re thinking of going to look around some of the shops and to look at the wall
around the city, so we’ll probably be there most of the day.
 In that case you are probably best taking a taxi or the bus.
 How much is a taxi?
 Into town it will be about 12 pounds. Actually, no I’d say it’s around 15 pounds -
fares have increased recently. We can book it here for you and it will pick you up
outside. It only takes about 10 minutes.
 Right, I see. What about the bus? How much is that and where does it go from?
 It’s only 2 pounds per person. It’s not far from here. You go out of here, turn right on
to Oak Tree Avenue, and it’s about a five minute walk down the road. You can’t miss
it. The bus ride is about 15 minutes.
 Oh, ok. Maybe we could do that.
 Or you could walk actually if you like walking. Part of the way you can walk through
the nice park which is fairly popular with visitors to York. It’s about 30 minutes but
it’s quite pleasant.
 Right, well there’s a few options there. We’ll have a think about it. I’ll go and get my
wife and kids. They are just waiting in the car.
 Ok, no problem. Thanks for booking with us.
